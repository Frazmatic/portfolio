      "description": "During my eight years serving active duty in the US Air Force, I dragged 2-kilometer fiber reels across the desert, managed networks with thousands of users, led large scale technical projects covering hundreds of buildings, and liaised with the heads of lettered federal agencies. In the civilian world Iâ€™ve worked every tier of IT support, from customer help desk, to providing Tier III maintenance for an assortment of IT systems. I have been responsible for mission critical systems in literally life or death situations; while working with military, civilian, and foreign national professionals in six different nations. I have a broad educational background, including social science disciplines such as psychology, anthropology, and economics, as well as coursework in statistics, information science, and computer science. I believe the breadth and diversity of my experience lends itself to the analysis of a wide range of complex systems, and solving problems within them.",
